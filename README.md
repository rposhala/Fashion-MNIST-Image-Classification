# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification
Convolutional Neural Networks were built, trained for image classification task for Fashion-MNIST dataset.
CNN models, techniques for preventing overfitting and various data augmentation tools were explored and CNN models were fine-tuned to achieve validation/test accuracy more than 92%.

ConvNets were tuned with respect to overfitting of the model on training data. To counter avoidable bias problem, data augmentation was used to increase the training data and it was found to be an effective method and yielded us an accuracy of 93.4%
